This directory contains the entities (or “named entities”) for 5 volumes of anthologies of the National Negro Health News quarterly publication, jointly published by the National Negro Health Movement and the U.S. Public Health Service, and for 15 volumes of anthologies of publications released during National Negro Health Week, an annual observance jointly organized by the National Negro Health Movement and the U.S. Public Health Service. These volumes were identified and compiled by Dr. Kim Gallon. 

The entities are available as two zip archives:

- `history-of-black-writing-entities.zip` contains a single `.csv` file containing all the entities for all 1997 volumes.
- `history-of-black-writing-entities-by-volume.zip` includes the same data as a separate `.csv` file for each of the 1997 volumes.

The entities were extracted using the open-source [spaCy](https://spacy.io) Natural Language Processing (NLP) library. Please see the spaCy [documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features/#named-entities) for more details about the data found in the `.csv` files.
